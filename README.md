# Better Adventures+ Paper

FlowSMP client-side modpack.

Pack inspiration:

```

We all love Minecraft, but it can get a bit stale at times. This modpack contains almost 100 mods that will enhance the Vanilla experience.



You will find dozens of quality of life mods, visual changes, added ambience, and more, which will breathe life into your worlds and builds. These mods have also been tested on a modded Fabric server, so you can play with your friends too if you decide to set that up!



Also, please support the creators of all of these mods and added content! They make great stuff, go check them out!
